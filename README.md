# Bistro2Go Web App
 Clark University Fall 2023 Hackathon submission. A web app for Clark University students to use to 
 order on-campus Bistro food items online so that they can stop by and pick up their food on their schedule.
 This web app would help students manage their schedules and spend less time waiting for food as they could 
 use the web app to order ahead of time. This solution would still need backend integration to be fully 
 functional. Placed 2nd in Hackathon.

 This solution is coded primarily in Python using the Django framework. Additional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was
 added for frontend usability and design.
